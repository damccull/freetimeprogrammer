My name is David McCullough. I program as a hobby or for small side jobs and love the challenge. I've been programming since 1997 and started with QBasic. Since then I've used C, C++, Java, and finally found my love in C#. I had experience with several other languages as well, though I was never as fluent in them.

I also enjoy more general IT things like configuring and running servers, networking devices, and storage stuff.

I started this blog because of a single post I wanted to write, but I think I will continue to write up tutorials and lessons to help others learn the things I've struggled with myself.

I hope you enjoy your time here.
